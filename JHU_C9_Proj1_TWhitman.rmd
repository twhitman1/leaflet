## Introduction

Leaflet is a Javascript library of interactive maps, enabled for use in R via "leaflet" package.  This assignment is a brief and simple sample/exploration of this pacakage.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(leaflet)
library(dplyr)
```

## Using Leaflet to create the map

Per assignment, I will now create a web page using R Markdown, which features a map created with Leaflet, for hosting via my GitHub page.  This will mark the pitcher's mound in Citizen's Bank Park.

```{r map}
map1 <- leaflet() %>% addTiles() %>% addMarkers(lng=-75.166564, lat=39.905738, popup = "Phightin Phils!")
map1
```
